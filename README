This is a simple rails application to track a generic set of games and winners and rank players based on wins and losses.


=====================

Note: The documentation below not be as thorough as extensive generated documentation, but it is much easier to view at a glance
and easier to create and maintain and if weâ€™re all on the same page it is just as insightful.


A GENERAL GUIDELINE FOR CALLING RESTFUL API ENDPOINTS

All the endpoints are implemented through paths that follows this standard REST routing pattern.
By using standard REST, Available endpoints as well as input and responses can be inferred by examining the application data model (schema.rb)

POST / [plural model name] - create a new model, input a json representation of the new model, will return the newly created model
PUT / [plural model name] / id  - update, input a json representation of the model, will return the updated model
GET / [plural model name] / id - get a specific item, will return a json reprentation of the model
GET / [plural model name] - index, or a list of items, possibly filtered by parameters, will return a json array of the model objects
DELETE / plural model name / id - delete an object

Some example Paths:
POST /tokens?username=lsease@gmail.com&password=password
GET /restaurants?access_token=[token]?format=json


NESTED JSON OBJECTS:
Note that objects rendered as json may include nested objects and relationships, but these must be explicitly defined in the controllers. Response objects that include nested objects in their response json will be documented below with the following syntax:
Parent => (includes Children)

JSON FORMAT:
You will need to throw a ?format=json or a format type header of application/json in your api call URL at the end to tell the api to render json instead of HTML

AUTHENTICATED REQUESTS:
Once logged in, when performing authenticated requests, pass in an access_token parameter.
You may also pass an "Authorization" header with "Bearer [access token]"

NESTED RESOURCES:
Some resources are defined as nested resources in routes.rb and can be accessed via nested routes, so for example, if a child is a nested resource of a parent, you would do
POST /parents/1/children to add a new child to that parent
and get /parents/1/children to list all of that parents children
This would be represented in routes.rb by
resources :parents do
	resources :children
end
